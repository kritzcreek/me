Prigogine's equations, with a few notes, translated into lisp. For my own practice and reference.

## Force

From page 2:

> For Aristotle, physics was the science of processes, of changes that occur in nature (Ross 1955). However, for Galileo and other founders of modern physics, the only change that could be expressed in precise mathematical terms was acceleration, the variation in the state of motion. This led finally to the fundamental equation of classical mechanics, which relates acceleration to force, F:

$$ m \frac{d^2r}{dt^2} = F $$

> Henceforth physical time was identified with the time, $t$, that appeas in the classical equations of motion.
