Perhaps no concept is more pondered about than love. It sits in the back of the mind as one decides how greatly to involve oneself in the lives of others. It surfaces in a hot pressure when one idolizes another before one really knows why. It often seems that one cannot know how profoundly love affects decisions, actions, and thoughts, nor can one know the nature, origin, or rationality behind the love sentiment felt; it is relegated to a mysticism. I would like to argue otherwise: love is an intelligible concept when subjected to phenomenological analysis. While much of the question of love is wrapped in mystery and wonder, this does not preclude it from analysis; indeed, love has been analyzed since the time of Plato’s Symposium, and it holds a special importance in the philosophies of Emmanuel Levinas and Luce Irigaray.
Typical analyses of love have divided the concept into three or more types: agape, or compassionate love; eros, or sexual love; and philia, or preferential, friendly love. I will discuss romantic love, a definition of love that is similar to eros but goes beyond mere physicality. Romantic love requires both phenomenology and ethics as it consists of a dynamic movement between the infinitude of the other and the intimacy of the self. Levinas attempts to establish a new phenomenologically-based ethics of otherness and infinity, an ethics that is grounded in the phenomenological experience of the self and the other. He provides a framework from which one can analyze the so-called mysteries of love. Irigaray explains how sexual difference is fundamental to the organization of relationships, and gives a practical foundation for moving beyond stereotypical gender roles. She allows the ground for applying the Levinasian framework to the biological and sexual reality of relationships with significant others.
Additionally, Levinas and Irigaray have a unique relationship in that they are gender opposites analyzing sexual differences and the relationship between these differences. Each is limited by their sexed and gendered condition, but contributes what the other is lacking: Levinas gives the male interpretation, and Irigaray the female. By understanding the work of each thinker and considering them together, one may begin to build the new ethics that each thinker wanted. 
After recounting the ethical and phenomenological situation that Levinas uncovers (and with which Irigaray will largely concur), I will argue that the passion of wonder should have a fundamental role in all analyses of ethics and love. I will show how wonder can uphold difference in the romantic-erotic relationship, change the way the ego relates to the other, allow for the persistence of love over time, and enhance the dimensionality experienced by the self as it illuminates the infinitude of the other.
I will proceed with a definition of difference that includes both ethical alterity and sexual difference. I will also take up Levinas’ definition of ethics as a layered experience of the relationship with the human other (intersubjectivity) as it relates to a person’s interiority and exteriority. Levinas’ ethics is important because it maintains a sense of the “height” of alterity, from whence desire and infinitude originally come. Irigaray’s analysis of wonder and sexual difference converges with Levinas’ framework and helps to explain the unique intimacy felt in romantic relationships. However, before one understands how wonder, desire, and infinitude work, one must understand how the ego and the self relate to the world by itself.
